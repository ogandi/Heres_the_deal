# Heres the deal

I have created a mock store front which uses posted links to direct a community of users to a deal/product store page through a link. The idea for this project was to practice building a a functional sotre front with the post user expereience in mind. Once i have learned REACT i plan to transfer and scale, pushing for monetisation through affiliate links and advertising through socials.
